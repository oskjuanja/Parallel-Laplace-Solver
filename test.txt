1. Try only jacobi to see if there is speedup with increased # of threads.
2. Try making interpolation/restriction serial.
3. Make one plot displaying non-equilibrium.
4. Maybe try the other BC to see if still slowdown.

5. Try removing lock and instead using array of maxErr's-
6. Instead of swapping.
